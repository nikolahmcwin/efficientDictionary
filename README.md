This group assignment was for COSC242 in 2017. The requirements  were to create an efficient container for storing and searching dictionary words. Both a Red Black Tree and a Hash Table are implemented and the user can choose which they prefer.

 
 Enter the program via asgn.c. It takes command line arguments and performs on them.
 @author Daniela Lemow, Megan Seto and Nikolah Pearce.
 
 
 Enter -h on the command line to display the user input help.
 Usage: [filename] [args] 
* Enter -r for robust chaining.
* Enter -s then an int to set table size.
* Enter -p to print the hashtable.
* Enter -i to print timing information.
* Required: [filename] to read words from.
  
The input file need only be a list of words, on any number of lines. 
Any special characters and case are ignored.
